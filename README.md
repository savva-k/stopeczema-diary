# Stopeczema Diary App

The application constists of 2 subprojects:
* stopeczema-diary-api – API written in Java
* stopeczema-diary-front – front-end part that uses React and [Material UI Next](https://material-ui-next.com) for rendering data

This README _hopefully_ will contain instructions about how to run the application on a local machine.
